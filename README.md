Experimental machine learning project to predict the Bitcoin price with the help of various data sources like Exchange Data, Sentimental Data, Technical Analysis and Real-Time Data.
DARTS gave us the best results in our research, while LSTM was hard to build form scratch and less accurate.
My Team and me reached a (SMAPE) avg. error of just 6% in some of our tests.
The project has been developed in 9 days. Of cause, there is a bunch of futures we still can optimize.
